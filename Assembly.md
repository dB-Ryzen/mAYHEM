# Overview

The PortaPack H1 must be attached to a HackRF One.

## Extract the HackRF One Circuit Board

Starting with a HackRF One in its case:

* Disconnect all cables and antennas from the HackRF One.
* For each of the three SMA connectors:
    * Remove the red "nipple".
    * Loosen the gold nut.
    * Remove the gold nut, crown washer, and flat washer.
* Using the yellow ShareBrained "spudger" tool (also known as a 0.73mm Dunlop Tortex guitar pick):
    * Insert the edge of the spudger tool into the gap in the plastic case.
    * Slide the tool along the gap while pushing it into the gap, perpendicular to the case.
    * At some point, the tool will slide in a bit further. Run the tool along the gap to separate the internal locking tabs between the two case pieces.

Here's a video of how it's done (links to YouTube):
