# Overview

The PortaPack H1 must be attached to a HackRF One.

## Extract the HackRF One Circuit Board

Starting with a HackRF One in its case:

* Disconnect all cables and antennas from the HackRF One.
* For each of the three SMA connectors:
    * Remove the red "nipple".
    * Loosen the gold nut.
    * Remove the gold nut, crown washer, and flat washer.
* Using the yellow ShareBrained "spudger" tool (also known as a 0.73mm Dunlop Tortex guitar pick):
    * Insert the edge of the spudger tool into the gap in the plastic case.
    * Slide the tool along the gap while pushing it into the gap, perpendicular to the case.
    * At some point, the tool will slide in a bit further. Run the tool along the gap to separate the internal locking tabs between the two case pieces.

Here's a video of how it's done (links to YouTube):

## Attach PortaPack H1 to HackRF One

## Install PortaPack Board Assembly into (optional) Case

If you got the optional aluminum case, here's how to install the PortaPack + HackRF board assembly into the case.

* For each of the five mounting holes:
    * Take an M3 bolt and thread an M3 tooth-lock washer on to it.
    * Take a spacer and insert it between the PortaPack and HackRF boards, at the position of the mounting hole.
    * Insert the bolt-washer combination through the mounting hole in the PortaPack, the spacer, and the HackRF.
* One side of the board stack has two gold SMA connectors. Insert those connectors through the corresponding large, round holes inside the case.
* The two bolts closest to the two SMA connectors need to be pulled up about one centimeter (half an inch) to clear the bottom of the case.
* Rock the opposite edge of the board assembly so that it drops into the case.
* Re-attach the gold washers and nuts onto the three SMA connectors. Install them in this order: smooth washer, tooth-lock washer, nut.
* Re-attach the three red "nipples".
