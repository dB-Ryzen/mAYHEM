Tips on how to care for your PortaPack:

* Do not pack the PortaPack with heavy or blunt objects. The LCD display is easy to crush. The touch screen glass is not smartphone glass, and is therefore more fragile and brittle.
* Do not overtighten RF cables to the HackRF SMA connectors. If you tighten too much, the SMA connector can snap off the HackRF board.
* Disconnect all cables and connectors before storing your PortaPack. Sideways force on plugs can loosen and damage PortaPack and HackRF connectors.
